Challenge 2 Repo - Portfolio

## Created a portfolio that I will use in the future
- My motivation was to create a portfolio where I can showcase my projects throughout my course. 
- I started from scratch to create the web page. I struggled with the flexbox elements initially and with getting items aligned as needed. 
- It solved my issue of not being able to showcase my work
- I learned that I still have lots to learn when creating a web page

##There are no steps to install this project

##Usage - This website can be accessed by my intructors and future companies that can see my work to consider me for hire and have a reference of my skills.  

#Road Map - The index.html will need to be updated in the near future to allow the content to be better visible on the web page.
